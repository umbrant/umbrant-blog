			<!-- Hyde::Article::Begin -->

<!-- Hyde::Excerpt::Begin -->

<p>I like to take some time every once in a while to think about what I&#8217;ve done that I&#8217;m proud of, what I&#8217;ve learned, and what I want to do. With the beginning of a new year comes the perfect opportunity to reflect on my life in the year&nbsp;past.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve split it into two separate blog posts, one <a href="/blog/2012/year_in_review_2011_professional.html">professional</a> (meaning research and grad school life) and one <a href="year_in_review_2011_personal.html">personal</a> (meaning hobbies, self-improvement, life goals). This post covers the latter; my personal life in&nbsp;2011.</p>
<!-- Hyde::Excerpt::End -->

<p>This post is also split up into different sections. The first is again accomplishments, then I cover time management, my 3 main hobbies these days, and then misc other personal&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Got a bugfix patch into Hadoop. This happened at one of the Cloudera hackathons, I showed up and fixed something off <span class="caps">JIRA</span>, and now people are using it. It&#8217;s not quite the Linux kernel patch on my <a href="/bucket.html">bucket list</a>, but it&#8217;s a&nbsp;step.</li>
<li>Bootstrapped myself as a guitarist. Literally just bought one and started playing last January, and it&#8217;s worked out&nbsp;okay.</li>
<li>Became a better public speaker. I credit the two hours of teaching section every week. I&#8217;m not ready to cross it off the bucket list yet (might never), but I think I&#8217;ve&nbsp;improved.</li>
<li>Can order Indian food reasonably well. Credit here goes to Zaika Tuesdays last&nbsp;semester.</li>
<li>I got my <span class="caps">RSI</span> under control. I was actually worried in the summer that I&#8217;d have to drop out of grad school and find a new profession unrelated to a keyboard, but it turned out okay after physical&nbsp;therapy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Time&nbsp;management</h3>
<ul>
<li>Overall, I&#8217;m reasonably happy with how much I got done. I&#8217;d estimate my productivity these days at somewhere around 70-80%, and there&#8217;s always going to be some slop&nbsp;there.</li>
<li>Balance. I spent last semester either working furiously or burnt out, and that&#8217;s not optimal. Being burnt out basically gives you an excuse to not do anything for an indefinite amount of time, and I hate making excuses to&nbsp;myself.</li>
<li>To add to the previous point, I think having regular, recurring events each week will help me stay&nbsp;sane.</li>
<li>Intentionally scheduling my meetings early was a great way of forcing myself to work almost a&nbsp;9-to-5.</li>
<li>Getting enough sleep actually happened last semester, and it was glorious. This also goes back to not making excuses to myself (about underachieving because I&#8217;m&nbsp;tired).</li>
<li>I need to make conscious decisions to do less of some things and more of others, since time is&nbsp;precious.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<h4>Cooking</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cooking has tapered off as an interest, as I&#8217;ve achieved some level of optimality in the &#8220;effort expended vs. output achieved&#8221; metric. I don&#8217;t have hours every week to spend cooking up new&nbsp;stuff.</li>
<li>I still think it&#8217;d be good to do something new once a week, or once a month. I&#8217;m going to avoid anything elaborate or complicated though, I&#8217;m past that&nbsp;phase.</li>
<li>I do want to keep cooking club going this year though, since it fell flat as soon as I got swamped with teaching and research last semester. It fulfills a social niche that isn&#8217;t met by weekend parties, and it&#8217;s nice to have some continuity with the same group of people.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Guitar</h4>
<ul>
<li>Guitar-wise, I need to be more structured about how I practice. Focus on repetition until mastery, not just noodling around for an&nbsp;hour.</li>
<li>I want to make it a goal to play more with other people, since doing it over break was a lot of&nbsp;fun.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m also going to make it a point to improv 12-bar blues as part of my practice&nbsp;sessions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bicycling</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bicycling was something I missed a bunch when I was working furiously, it was a really great way of starting off my&nbsp;Saturdays.</li>
<li>I want to find some new rides, since doing 3 Bears is getting a little&nbsp;repetitive.</li>
<li>The cycling list died out a bit when I stopped organizing rides; I&#8217;d like to get it to the point where it&#8217;s stable without&nbsp;me.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m not convinced I want to stick with the PhD thing all the way through yet. Grad school hasn&#8217;t exactly been smooth sailing for me, but it seems to be trending upwards. This will be an important year in making a decision, since the master&#8217;s is a good drop-out&nbsp;point.</li>
<li>Balance again. I still do believe in work-life integration, but when you&#8217;re working 12-16 hours 6 days a week and eating out for every meal because of it, it&#8217;s gone too&nbsp;far.</li>
<li>I need to write in my journal more, and write more blog posts about things I find&nbsp;interesting.</li>
<li>Strangely, I think I need to spend more money. When you&#8217;re living on a grad student stipend, that little bit you could save has a high marginal utility if spent&nbsp;instead.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m looking forward to <span class="caps">TGIF</span> with my cube from now on, the one time we did it in December before everyone left was&nbsp;great.</li>
</ul>
