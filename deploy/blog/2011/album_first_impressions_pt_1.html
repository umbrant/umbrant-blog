<!-- Hyde::Excerpt::Begin -->

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten some large influxes of music recently, posting my first impressions of eight albums I&#8217;ve given a listen or two. It&#8217;s a pretty eclectic mix, new and old stuff. Reviews are unordered, and only qualitative ratings. Unexpectedly, Kanye&#8217;s newest work is my favorite album of 2010. More to&nbsp;come.</p>
<!-- Hyde::Excerpt::End -->

<p><strong>James Brown - Love Power Peace (Live at the Olympia, Paris, 1971)</strong>: I have a soft spot for live albums, and this has to be among the best. I don&#8217;t have much exposure to funk (the closest thing being jazz fusion), but it&#8217;s easy to fall in love with the layered big-band instrumentation, high energy, and evocative call-and-response&nbsp;segments.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">LCD</span> Soundsystem - <span class="caps">LCD</span> Soundsystem</strong> and <strong><span class="caps">LCD</span> Soundsystem - Sound of Silver</strong>: I liked their most recent album <strong>This Is Happening</strong> quite a bit, so I checked out the rest of their discography. <span class="caps">LCD</span> Soundsystem has a pretty unique sound, rough and unvarnished singing/spoken word over some of the dirtiest bass lines and drops I&#8217;ve ever heard. It&#8217;s easy to see why their work is such an appealing target for remixers and DJs. I&#8217;d argue that James Murphy has taken the art of repetition to perfection, surpassing even French house demigods Daft Punk. I like these two albums less than This Is Happening, but they&#8217;re still going on my coding/work playlist since they&#8217;re quite listenable for long periods of&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><strong>Radiohead - King of Limbs</strong>: Disappointing. I had to come around to <strong>In Rainbows</strong>, which is now my favorite Radiohead album, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to acquire the taste of King of Limbs any time soon. It feels heavily influenced by dubstep, a genre of electronic music I&#8217;m not particularly infatuated with. I&#8217;m willing to give King of Limbs a few more listens because of brand loyalty, but it probably won&#8217;t make my list of top 5 favorite Radiohead&nbsp;albums.</p>
<p><strong>Regina Spektor - Begin to Hope</strong>: She reminds me of Feist, but with better clarity and range. I&#8217;m slowly adding female vocal music to my collection (see also: Cat Power), and this is a nice find. Where Feist has this airy, carefree feeling that permeates her music, Spektor is more raw, emotional, and pure. She also has some adorable speech impediment that makes <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zA4oG4FJFY">&#8220;better&#8221; sound like &#8220;betto&#8221;</a>.&nbsp;Recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Little Boots - Hands</strong>: I think she has mild internet fame for her videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CWBgm_-Ggs">playing</a> a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6tLRCDqJ2c">Tenori-on</a>, and now she has an album. It&#8217;s pop, which is not normally my thing, so it&#8217;s a bit hard for me to judge. It&#8217;s a little formulaic (expected), and reminds me of Lady Gaga, with a hip hop or alt rock feel. The autotune still grates on my ears, and is a waste of her talent. Probably won&#8217;t go on my regular listening rotation, but recommended for the&nbsp;genre.</p>
<p><strong>Robyn - Body Talk</strong>: Robyn is a Swedish pop/dance artist who turned down the recording contract that eventually went to Britney Spears. Happily, Robyn also makes much better music. I&#8217;ve been watching her since happening across <strong>Body Talk Pt <span class="caps">II</span></strong>; 2010 saw the release of <strong>Body Talk Pt I</strong> and <strong>Body Talk Pt <span class="caps">II</span></strong> as well as this most recent album, which pulls the hits from the first two Body Talk albums and adds a few new songs, forming what is effectively a &#8220;best of&#8221; compilation. Releasing three albums of new material in a year is impressive; even more impressive is the quality of each song on Body Talk. I could see any song off this album being a single. Recommended even if you don&#8217;t like pop. Listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA3j3VTAsTk">Fembot</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ketX6HITIDU">Indestructible</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Kanye West - My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</strong>: There&#8217;s a reason this album made numerous &#8220;best of 2010&#8221; lists. <em>It&#8217;s the best fucking album of 2010</em>. I can hardly believe I&#8217;m saying this, but I actually like it more than Arcade Fire&#8217;s 2010 entry, The Suburbs. I heard <span class="caps">MBDTF</span>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-qKboHKPEA">opener</a>, and was already overwhelmed. I could go through and recommend each track on the album for a different reason, but I&#8217;ll promote in particular <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek">Runaway</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VOVStL0NW0">Blame Game</a>. Kanye was always one of the best hip-hop producers in the business, and now he&#8217;s got the rapping chops to match. Sick beats abound. I love the super smooth production, every note is polished to a glossy sheen. I&#8217;m impressed with the variety in styles. To conclude: I don&#8217;t particularly like hip hop, I don&#8217;t like Kanye&#8217;s earlier work, I don&#8217;t like Kanye the person, but <strong>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</strong> is undeniably brilliant. It&#8217;s a hip hop album for the&nbsp;ages.</p>
