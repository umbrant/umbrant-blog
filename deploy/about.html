<p class="meta">&nbsp;</p>

			<div class="entry">
			

			<p>I am currently enjoying life as a computer science graduate student at the <a href="http://eecs.berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a>. I did my undergraduate degree in computer science at the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a> (B.S. 2010), and my high school education at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology">Thomas Jefferson HSST</a> in Alexandria, VA (2007). My research interests are in distributed systems and datacenters, see my <a href="/research.html">research page</a> for details on my academic projects and&nbsp;papers.</p>
<p>As clich&eacute;d and hopelessly idealistic as it may sound, my goal in life is to change the world for the better. I'm heavily impact driven, and any future career I choose will involve solving real world problems that tangibly affect people's lives. I also keep a <a href="/bucket.html">bucket list</a> of personal growth items that I want to accomplish. It's still short, but I take completing and updating it pretty seriously. It's a way of putting life in perspective and focusing on what is worthwhile and&nbsp;meaningful.</p>
<h3>Work&nbsp;experience</h3>
<p>During undergrad, I interned twice at <a href="http://navigationarts.com">NavigationArts</a>, an enterprise web development company in McLean, VA, and once at <a href="http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sandiego/">SPAWAR Systems Center</a> in San Diego, CA, working on low-cost, long-range, ship-to-ship wireless communication with commodity 802.11 parts. As such, I have expertise in most aspects of web development, and consider myself a pretty good systems builder too. I still take the occasional web development contract, but at the time being, graduate school is my primary&nbsp;focus.</p>
<h3>Other&nbsp;activities</h3>
<p>Outside of school and work, I still keep myself distracted. I've taken up biking since coming to Berkeley, but my first love is for rowing, a sport I did for four years in high school with moderate championship success. I haven't had time to take it up again, but I'm looking forward to rowing on the Bay. These days I'm also teaching myself guitar, and I have a few years experience in each of piano and clarinet. I read for pleasure semi-regularly (philosophy, sci-fi, fantasy, history), and wish I had the time to make this a regular habit. My final passion is food: I'm an amateur cook (and dinner party organizer), and a closet&nbsp;foodie.</p>
