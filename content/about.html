{% block article %}

I am currently enjoying life as a computer science graduate student at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://eecs.berkeley.edu). I did my undergraduate degree in computer science at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu) (B.S. 2010), and my high school education at [Thomas Jefferson HSST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology) in Alexandria, VA (2007). My research interests are in distributed systems and datacenters, see my [research page]({{links.research}}) for details on my academic projects and papers.

As clich&eacute;d and hopelessly idealistic it may sound, my goal in life is to change the world for the better. I'm heavily impact driven, and any future career I choose will involve real world problems that tangibly affect people's lives. I also keep a [bucket list](/bucket.html) of personal growth items that I want to accomplish. It's still short, but I take completing and updating it pretty seriously. It's a way of putting life in perspective and focusing on what is worthwhile and meaningful.

### Work experience ###

During undergrad, I interned twice at [NavigationArts](http://navigationarts.com), an enterprise web development company in McLean, VA, and once at [SPAWAR Systems Center](http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sandiego/) in San Diego, CA, working on low-cost, long-range, ship-to-ship wireless communication with commodity 802.11 parts. As such, I have expertise in most aspects of web development, and consider myself a pretty good systems builder too. I still take the occasional web development contract, but at the time being, graduate school is my primary focus.

### Hobbies ###

Outside of school and work, I still keep myself distracted. I've taken up biking since coming to Berkeley, but my first love is for rowing, a sport I did for four years in high school with moderate championship success. I haven't had time to take it up again, but I'm looking forward to rowing on the Bay. These days I'm also teaching myself guitar, and I have a few years experience in each of piano and clarinet. I read for pleasure semi-regularly (philosophy, sci-fi, fantasy, history), and wish I had the time to make this a regular habit.
