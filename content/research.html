My research interests are in distributed systems and datacenter applications. At Berkeley, I was advised by Prof. [Ion Stoica](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) and was part of the [Algorithms, Machines and People (AMP) Lab](http://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/), one of the larger collaborative multi-area labs at Berkeley.

### Current Projects ###

As I have taken a position at Cloudera, I am not currently working on any new research projects.

### Past Projects ###

Cake (formerly Frosting) is a multi-resource scheduler for shared storage systems that supports enforcement of high-level service-level objectives. This allows latency-sensitive and batch workloads to be consolidated onto the same storage system, reducing provisioning costs, improving utilization, and shortening traditional copy-then-process analytics cycles. Cake was presented at SoCC 2012.

PACMan is an in-memory caching infrastructure for Hadoop and HDFS which is tuned for large datacenter workloads. We have developed novel cache management policies that perform significantly better than theoretically "optimal" cache-eviction algorithms (such as farthest-in-the-future) by exploiting characteristics of workload traces from large internet companies. This was published at NSDI 2012.

[CrowdDB](http://www.crowddb.org/) is a relational database that has been extended with crowdsourcing operators, allowing it to incorporate human computation and knowledge as part of query execution. This means CrowdDB can be used to solve AI-hard problems that are difficult to tackle with traditional databases by crowdsourcing small tasks to human workers. I contributed to a demo of CrowdDB shown at VLDB 2011 in Seattle, which won the inaugural Best Demo award.
